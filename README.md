# AutoSavePrivateReplay

Automatically saves replays from selected playlists

Enable by pressing f2 to open your bakkesmod plugins and selecting each of your preferred playlists. Useful for ranked leagues where you need to provide replay proof of games or just to save all of your hardcore chaos matches for replay analysis. 

*Note* offline playlists aren't working properly right now, will be fixed when I have some time.

*Note* old version used "ranked_autosavereplay_private_only 1" for private matches. Now uses "ranked_autosavereplay_privatematch 1".
